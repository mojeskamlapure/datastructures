Dynamic Programming:
	Its an optimization technique usisng cache. Do you have something you can cache?
	Its breaking of problems into sub problems , solving each of the sub problems just once.

	Dynamic Programming = Divide & Conquer + Memoization
	Rules:
		1. can be divided into sub problems 
		2. recursive solutions
		3. are there repetative sub-problems
		4. memoize subproblems

Approaches:		
	Memoization:
		caching is a way to store values so that can be used later.
		its a specific form of caching.
	
	Bottom-Up Approach:
